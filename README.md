# MattsTechInfo.github.io
Welcome to the GitHub repo for the [mattstech.info](https://mattstech.info) website hosted by GitHub pages.
The whole setup has been open-sourced so you can have a look around, see how I've built things and how you can replicate it. You are free to copy work or even duplicate all content for your own safekeeping.

## Jekyll based
This website is based on Jekyll and uses markdown to generate static HTML pages without any form of back-end. Essentially Jekyll is the bare-bones engine where normally I would use (for example) Wordpress. The reason I've switched to using Jekyll with GitHub Pages is the simplicity, open-source nature and speed. For more information please see the Jekyll foundation documentation [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on how to run your own installation.

## Chirpy theme
As you can see on the top left of this repository, this has all been generated from an awesome project by cotes2020. Which doesn't just generate all the code using Jekyll, it's a fully fledged theme with additional functionality. The theme fits my purposes and cotes2020 made it extremely easy to get started for yourself. If you want to give it a try, please see the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#documentation) or jump right in and generate your own Jekyll site with the Chirpy theme with a few simple steps [chirpy-starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate).
