## NLVMUG
Last year I was at the NLVMUG Usercon as a visitor and learned a lot from great sessions throughout the day. The NLVMUG Usercon is the biggest VMUG Usercon in the world, there is a great amount of interest in quite a few sessions. After my visit last year, I decided this year I would apply for a speaker slot.
Great news, the request for a slot was granted! On top of that, my session was also marked as a top session not to miss!

## NSX-V vs. NSX-T
In my talk I will be focusing on the differences between V and T. VMware NSX is widely adopted as the main product for network virtualization and microsegmentation, the technology however is still quite new to a lot of companies.
Next to the differences between V and T I will talk about:

- which version to choose in which situation,
- migration possibilities,
- things you should keep in mind about NSX in general.

## When & Where
My session will be at March 21st at 15:50 PM at “De Fabrique” in Utrecht.
The NLVMUG is a Dutch event, therefor I will be speaking Dutch.
