## Public Talk
On the 31st of October my colleague Robin van Altena and I will host a talk at the Infosecurity venue (Dutch) about our experience running VMware and Palo Alto for microsegmentation (NSX) and segmentation (Palo Alto) purposes.

The talk is focused around the journey one of our customers went through being one of the first to implement NSX and what we did to make it all work. We will talk about the pioneering work we had to do, do’s and don’ts, things we’ve learned and things we’d do differently now.

Of course there will be time to ask additional questions afterwards!

## Where and when
You can join the session by registering at the Infosecurity web page. We are speaking in Theater 16 at 14:00 hours.
