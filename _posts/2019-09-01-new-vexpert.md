This is a short update and notification. After I got back from my holiday I was greeted by a nice e-mail from the VMware vExpert team:

> It is with great pleasure that we welcome you to the vExpert program.

## Yay!
I’m so happy to be part of the vExpert program now, it’s a great recognition for the public events I’ve visited as speaker and at the same time I’m grateful my employer gave me time to pursue all of this.

## Content
With the vExpert status I hope I can be of service to a lot of other professionals working with the VMware portfolio. New content is underway on this blog, I hope you will like it!

As always, don’t be afraid to ask any questions in the comments or other channels.
