Today I successfully passed the Architecting on AWS course!

## AWS
Why AWS when you are a VMware guy you might ask?
Well, the world is moving guys! AWS is there not to take away customers from your beloved VMware environment, it’s there to add to it. In the future we will probably be using hybrid clouds and eventually it seems likely that a hybrid connection between vSphere on site and AWS in the cloud is really going to happen.

To not lag behind, AWS knowlegde is needed to set up the infrastructure we will be using to connect on premise to the cloud and create a seamless hybrid environment.

## But, certification?
Although there is an official exam for the final certification, that’s not currently on my to-do list. It will be on the low priority lane for me.
